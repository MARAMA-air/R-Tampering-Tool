# R-Tampering-Tool
Diesel Tampering Tool created by Jenny St. Clair

This tool is designed to provide flexible estimates of annual NOx and PM2.5 emissions for Mid-Atlantic and Northeast states using user-input data.

As newer and more robust data about illegal tampering of emissions control devices on diesel vehicles becomes available, this tool will allow states to update their estimates on the fly.
